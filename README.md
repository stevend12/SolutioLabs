# SolutioLabs
A series of computational labs, using the SolutioCpp library, to demonstrate concepts in medical physics. 
The repository consists of a series stand-alone C++ programs (Source folder), each paired with a Octave/MATLAB (.m) script (Plot folder). 
Each C++ program outputs results to a text (.txt) file, and the corresponding .m file reads in and displays the data results.
To use these labs, create a directory named "Build" on the same level as the Source and Plot directories.
Use CMake to compile all the programs into this folder, run the programs, and use Octave/MATLAB to plot the results.
